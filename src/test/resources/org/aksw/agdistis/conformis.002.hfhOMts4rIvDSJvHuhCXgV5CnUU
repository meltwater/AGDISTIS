“We are thrilled to be commemorating this important company milestone together with our deeply committed team of <entity>ConforMIS</entity> employees dedicated to delivering innovative, high quality technology. We are in the business of helping surgeons and healthcare professionals treat their knee replacement patients by offering them a broad line of customized knee implants for individualized orthopedic care. Understanding that patient-to-patient communication is one of the most meaningful experiences for potential patients seeking joint replacement options, we are excited to introduce a new program designed to facilitate and enable patient connectivity,” said <entity>Philipp Lang</entity>, <entity>MD</entity>, <entity>MBA</entity>, Chief <entity>Executive Officer</entity> and President of <entity>ConforMIS</entity>. “With over 50,000 implants sold, we feel the timing is right to launch this initiative. Our patients are unique, each and every one of them, and our <entity>Patient Ambassador Program</entity> will allow the everyday <entity>ConforMIS</entity> patient to share his or her story with others fighting a similar battle.”

This week <entity>ConforMIS</entity> is holding its first <entity>Patient Ambassador Summit</entity>, a special gathering of patients from across the <entity>United States</entity> treated with <entity>ConforMIS</entity> customized knee implants in one or both knees. This group includes some of the earliest patients to be treated with a ConforMIS knee implant alongside more recent patients. The Patient Ambassador group is comprised of patients that have either a partial or total <entity>ConforMIS</entity> customized knee replacement ranging from the iUni, iTotal CR and iTotal <entity>PS</entity>, and each will share their personal story. This week, these patients will have the opportunity to experience firsthand how <entity>ConforMIS</entity> solutions are individually designed and manufactured using its proprietary software and 3D printing technology.

Each ConforMIS partial and total knee implant, including iTotal® CR, iTotal® <entity>PS</entity>, iDuo® and iUni®, is developed using proprietary algorithms and computer software to map the articular surfaces of the knee joint, define the areas of disease and convert the imaging data into a three-dimensional model of the knee. ConforMIS engineers then use computer-aided design, or CAD, software to design the customized implant and single-use, sterile surgical instrumentation that will precisely match the three dimensional model of the patient's knee.

The focus on innovation in customized implants continues today at <entity>ConforMIS</entity>. In March 2016 the company launched iTotal <entity>PS</entity>, which nearly triples the company’s addressable market. Like iTotal CR, iTotal <entity>PS</entity> implants are customized for each patient to avoid compromises on implant fit, rotation and alignment, which can cause residual pain and functional limitations after surgery.
