6.How sustainable is solar energy?

At <entity>BBOXX</entity>, we offer an on-grid experience in an off-grid setting. What this is means is that the same services (or even better) from the grid connection, you can get with Solar. People are not very concerned about what’s on the roof, whether it’s a solar panel or a grid cable. They are more interested in what they use it for and this could be lighting, phone charging, TV, fan and how much it costs them. The challenge for Solar companies is to prove that they can provide this level of service. Otherwise it is as good as any other source., we have a lot of people connected to the grid contacting, but our main focus at the moment is rural electrification We are however in the process of testing solar home systems suitable for modern urban settings.
