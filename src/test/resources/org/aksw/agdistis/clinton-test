<entity>Democratic</entity> vice presidential candidate <entity>Tim Kaine</entity> is criticizing his debate opponent, <entity>Republican</entity> <entity>Mike Pence</entity>, for saying "that <entity>Mexican</entity> thing" during their Tuesday faceoff.

<entity>Kaine</entity> says <entity>Pence</entity> has shown disrespect to "an entire group of people who are entitled to dignity and respect."

<entity>Pence</entity> made the comment as he tried to brush aside criticism of <entity>Donald Trump</entity>'s comments about <entity>Mexican</entity> immigrants being criminals and rapists.

<entity>Kaine</entity> asks, "Who talks like that?"

<entity>Kaine</entity> made the comments Thursday at the carpenters' union hall in <entity>Las Vegas</entity>. The senator from <entity>Virginia</entity> also stressed <entity>Hillary Clinton</entity>'s commitment to labor unions, saying <entity>Clinton</entity> would ensure that her nominees for the <entity>U.S. Supreme Court</entity> would be sympathetic to the labor movement.

An organization representing more than 6,000 <entity>Latino</entity> evangelical churches in the <entity>U.S.</entity> is endorsing <entity>Hillary Clinton</entity> over <entity>Donald Trump</entity>.

<entity>OPEN USA</entity> says faith has played a central role in the lifelong commitment to public service of both <entity>Clinton</entity> and her running mate, <entity>Virginia</entity> Sen. <entity>Tim Kaine</entity>. The group says the <entity>Democrats</entity>' commitment to public service is exemplified through their campaign's focus on embracing diverse perspectives and creating an inclusive America

<entity>Donald Trump</entity> is sending his thoughts and prayers to the millions who may be affected by Hurricane <entity>Matthew</entity>.

<entity>Trump</entity> is telling a <entity>New Hampshire</entity> town hall audience that he spoke with Gov. <entity>Rick Scott</entity> of <entity>Florida</entity> earlier Thursday.

The <entity>GOP</entity> nominee says that, "Whatever happens, we're with everybody because it looks like it's going to be a very bad - maybe the worst in a long period of time."

<entity>Trump</entity> says he has a lot of friends, investments and employees in the regions the hurricane is expected to hit. His home in <entity>Palm Beach</entity> - Mar-a-<entity>Lago</entity> - is in the path of the storm.

Spokeswoman <entity>Hope Hicks</entity> said earlier that <entity>Trump</entity> spoke with his employees there and urged them to take safety precautions.

<entity>Trump</entity> said in <entity>New Hampshire</entity> to the millions of people in the storm's way: "Please know that we are praying for you and everyone in the path: You've got to take care of yourself, you've got to get out of the area, you've got to listen."

<entity>Donald Trump</entity>'s town hall event in <entity>New Hampshire</entity> is the same general format as Sunday's debate against <entity>Hillary Clinton</entity>. There's a two-minute clock timing each of his answers. And standing off to the side is <entity>New Jersey</entity> Gov. <entity>Chris Christie</entity>, who coaching the <entity>Republican</entity> presidential candidate for Sunday's showdown.

But <entity>Trump</entity> is staunchly denying the event has anything to do with preparing for Sunday's town hall-style presidential debate.

<entity>Trump</entity> told the crowd, "This isn't practice. This has nothing to do with Sunday." He added that "We're just here because we just wanted to be here."

He's also lashing out at rival <entity>Hillary Clinton</entity>, claiming that she's not really preparing, but "resting."

<entity>Trump</entity> said he wants "to be with the people from <entity>New Hampshire</entity>," adding without evidence, "and she wants to rest."

<entity>Trump</entity> has held only a handful of town hall-style events over the course of his campaign, preferring giant rallies instead.

<entity>Florida</entity> Gov. <entity>Rick Scott</entity> is turning down a request from <entity>Hillary Clinton</entity>'s campaign to extend the state's voter registration deadline.

The deadline for <entity>Floridians</entity> to register is next Tuesday. The <entity>Clinton</entity> campaign says the deadline should be pushed back because Hurricane <entity>Matthew</entity> is threatening to wreak havoc on the state.

But <entity>Scott</entity> says "everyone has had a lot of time to register" and he doesn't intend to make any changes.

<entity>Scott</entity> is a <entity>Republican</entity> who is a strong supporter of <entity>GOP</entity> nominee <entity>Donald Trump</entity> and is chairman of a Super PAC running <entity>Clinton</entity>-bashing television ads. Normally, <entity>Scott</entity> would have no say over the state's voter registration deadline, but he has emergency powers during a hurricane that could allow him to push it back.

Hurricane <entity>Matthew</entity> is scheduled to hit <entity>Donald Trump</entity>'s prized Mar-a-<entity>Lago</entity> resort in <entity>Palm Beach</entity>, <entity>Florida</entity>, where the <entity>Republican</entity> presidential candidate often spends his winter down time and has held numerous campaign events.

The club hasn't opened for the season yet. But campaign spokeswoman <entity>Hope Hicks</entity> said that, "Mr. <entity>Trump</entity> spoke with employees yesterday to ensure they are safe and following instructions from local officials.

She added: "Sounds like they are taking the necessary precautions. We are hoping everyone is safe."

A dozen business leaders, including lifelong <entity>Republicans</entity> and independents, have written an open letter saying they cannot support <entity>Republican</entity> <entity>Donald Trump</entity> for president because he would be bad for the economy.

They write that, "<entity>American</entity> business needs as much predictability, reliability and stability in our government as possible."

A copy of the letter was given to <entity>The Associated Press</entity> ahead of the group's push for others to sign on, as well as the release of the group's new website on Friday.

Democratic strategist <entity>Steve Schale</entity> said he doesn't believe Hurricane <entity>Matthew</entity> changes the political situation in politically critical <entity>Florida</entity>.

<entity>Schale</entity> helped President <entity>Barack Obama</entity> win the state in 2008 and 2012 and says presidential campaigns are never going to be pretty in <entity>Florida</entity>."

He says "there's just not a lot you can do" to change the fact that presidential elections in <entity>Florida</entity> can be expected to always be close. He says both <entity>Donald Trump</entity>'s and <entity>Hillary Clinton</entity>'s campaigns are "doing what they should be doing, which is get their staffs out of harm's way and suspend activities" until the storm clears south <entity>Florida</entity>.

He acknowledges that lost ballots might happen on a bigger scale than usual because of the storm. But he says there are many checks in place to prevent disruption.

4:25 p.m.

<entity>House</entity> Speaker <entity>Paul Ryan</entity> says he's not appeared until now with <entity>Donald Trump</entity> because "I've been busy doing my job."

The <entity>Wisconsin</entity> congressman said during a brief interview that he wants to win "up and down the ballot," but his primary responsibility is the re-election of enough <entity>Republicans</entity> to maintain the <entity>House</entity> majority. He spoke during a campaign stop for <entity>GOP House</entity> candidate <entity>Lloyd Smucker</entity>, who is expected to win an open <entity>Republican</entity> seat near <entity>Harrisburg</entity>, <entity>Pennsylvania</entity>.

<entity>Ryan</entity> and <entity>Trump</entity> are scheduled to appear together on Saturday at an annual fall festival in <entity>Wisconsin</entity> that is expected to attract other state politicians.

The two men have had an uncomfortable relationship, with <entity>Ryan</entity> initially reluctant to endorse <entity>Trump</entity> before coming around. <entity>Ryan</entity> has criticized <entity>Trump</entity> over his call for a <entity>Muslim</entity> ban and slow disavowal of a white supremacist.

<entity>Tim Kaine</entity> is mocking <entity>Donald Trump</entity> for changing the title of his latest book from "<entity>Crippled America</entity>" to "Great Again."

<entity>Kaine</entity> said: "You can change the title of your book, but you are not going to change who you are, <entity>Donald Trump</entity>."

<entity>Politico</entity> reported Thursday that <entity>Trump</entity> and his publisher recently changed the title of <entity>Trump</entity>'s book and cover to include a picture of <entity>Trump</entity> smiling instead of scowling.

<entity>Kaine</entity> often uses <entity>Trump</entity>'s book as a prop on the campaign trail, saying it reflects <entity>Trump</entity>'s overly pessimistic view of the <entity>U.S.</entity> and its citizens

<entity>Donald Trump</entity>'s daughter <entity>Ivanka</entity> toured a southwest <entity>Ohio</entity> manufacturing plant and met with workers and businesswomen in a <entity>Republican</entity>-dominated region in the swing state.

<entity>Angela Phillips</entity>, the owner of <entity>Middletown Tube Works</entity>, guided <entity>Ivanka Trump</entity> on the visit Thursday that included a forum with local businesswomen.

<entity>Middletown</entity> is some 30 miles north of <entity>Cincinnati</entity>. It's a steel-mill city within a stretch of counties that have voted heavily for the <entity>Republican</entity> nominees in recent presidential elections.

The <entity>Trump</entity> campaign scrubbed a planned fundraising event featuring <entity>Ivanka Trump</entity> later Thursday in hurricane-threatened <entity>Florida</entity>.

<entity>Trump</entity>'s eldest daughter is one of his closest advisers and has played a highly visible role in the campaign, including appearing in a recent TV ad.

<entity>Hillary Clinton</entity>'s campaign is canceling ads that were to air on <entity>Florida</entity> stations that carry the Weather Channel. The decision comes as Hurricane Matthew gains strength.

<entity>Clinton</entity> spokesman <entity>Jesse Fergus</entity> said Thursday that the campaign asked the stations to delay the ads until after the storm passes.

The <entity>Florida Weather Channel</entity> ads were part of a multimillion-dollar reshuffling of <entity>Clinton</entity> ads to reach voters the campaign sees as critical to winning the election.

In the past few days, <entity>Clinton</entity> had added numerous local cable stations, including some carrying the <entity>Weather Channel</entity> in <entity>Florida</entity> and in <entity>New Hampshire</entity>.
