<entity>Axonify</entity> Announces Workplace Research That Reveals One-Third Of US Employees Receive No Formal Job Training

Dec 12, 2016 - 09:52 ET

<entity>WATERLOO</entity>, ON--(Marketwired - December 12, 2016) - <entity>Axonify</entity>, the company behind the world's first SaaS employee knowledge platform, today revealed new workplace research that finds that organizations are still struggling to provide employees with the formal training they need to do their jobs effectively. The study, conducted on behalf of <entity>Axonify</entity> by <entity>Ipsos</entity>, a global market research firm, included more than 1,000 employed adult respondents and uncovered a significant gap between the realities of formal job training and the types of training employees identify as effective.

We live in a world where ensuring employees have the right knowledge to achieve peak performance at work remains a pervasive problem despite advances in technology and an understanding of changing workplace dynamics. Companies spend more than $140 billion USD on training and development worldwide yet most organizations still rely on either outdated training methodologies, like learning management systems (LMSs) that cost thousands of dollars per employee, or provide no training at all1. The wide-ranging survey of employees across sectors uncovered that nearly one in two (46 percent) who receive formal training report that it is not very effective in helping them to succeed on the job. Moreover, the survey found that a surprising 30 percent of employees indicate they still receive no formal training on the job.

"Getting employees to consistently do the right thing at work is a critical part of achieving strategic business objectives, but far too few organizations offer training programs that are actually designed to help employees build knowledge and translate that knowledge to performance," said <entity>Axonify</entity> </entity>President & CEO</entity>, <entity>Carol Leaman</entity>. "It's time for companies to wake up and adopt modern, intuitive, and engaging training methodologies that meet the needs of today's workforce. With <entity>Axonify</entity>, the average cost of a year's worth of formal training is a fraction of traditional methods -- resulting in measurable outcomes that save organizations thousands, even millions of dollars each year."

Survey respondents showed strong agreement about what would matter to them in formal training programs, regardless of their experience with training at their current place of employment.

90 percent of respondents say training that is easy to complete and understand is important to them, with 55 percent saying it is very important.
A large majority of employees (87 percent) feel that it is important to have access to training information anytime, anywhere they need it to do their jobs, and over half of employees place a premium on this ability (51 percent say very important).
85 percent of employees say it's important that training is engaging and fun, with two in five (39 percent) citing this as being very important.
Another 85 percent of employees recognize the importance of training that's personalized and relevant to them, with another two in five (42 percent) rating personalization as being extremely important.

Feedback from <entity>Axonify</entity> customers is consistent with the survey results in that learners are demanding that training must be convenient, applicable to them, engaging, and specific in order to unlock employees' full potential and impact the business.

"Every day, we hear stories from our customers and prospects about the importance of transforming the way employees learn, but we wanted to know what organizations are actually doing," said <entity>Leaman</entity>. "That's why we decided to solicit anonymous feedback from learners in a risk-free setting. It seems that awareness about the need for change is growing in the C-suite, but actual change is slow and employees aren't yet seeing the dramatic shift they're looking for. The study validated that our ground-breaking work on the <entity>Axonify</entity> employee knowledge platform will meet the needs of the modern learner and continue to make a difference in every organization it touches."
